# MobilERP

A small self-hosted ERP that works with your smarphone and laptop.

## The idea

Have a small business who want or need an ERP but have no internet access or can't afford to pay a susbcrition to a cloud hosted service? This solution is for you.
You can either find someone to run this on Raspberry Pi and help you configure your Android phone to work with it or DIY.

This is MobilERP-server. Check the companion repo [MobilERP-android](https://github.com/eligiobz/mobilerp-android).

## What it currently does

Eats all your data, pillages your town and burns down your house. This means is working as intended. It also teams up teams up with [MobilERP-android](https://github.com/eligiobz/mobilerp-android). Seriously check it out.
